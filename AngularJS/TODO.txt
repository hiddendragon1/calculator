1. the property purchase value i want comma every 3 digit
it is hard to see how much i input without comma bc we are dealling with big numbers
don't want to miss count the zero

2. closing cost you need to be able to switch from pertenage and number
sometime people only know the number and not the acutal percentage

3. where is the question mark for closing cost??

4. can we have a little '$' sign instead of the enger second value here
it looks better with $

5. in bigger pocket you will be able to expand the renovation/repair cost into different categories should we do that???

6. holding period. how can that be negative. i can enter negative number and that doesn't make sense
